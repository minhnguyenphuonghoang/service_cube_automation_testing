# Description: This file shows you the instruction on how to:
				1. Set libraries, keywords, variables' name
				2. Organize test scripts, keywords

I. Organize test scripts, keyword
1. Structure: 

Project folder	
	| Test Suites  	
		| Suite Name 001.txt
		| Suite Name 002.txt
		...
	| GuiObjects
		| Python File 001.py
		| Python File 002.py
		...
	| Libs
		| Library File 001.py
		| Library File 002.py
		...
	| Resources
		| ScreenName001.txt
		| ScreenName002.txt
		| Variables.txt
		...
	| High Level Keywords
		| ScreenName001_HighLevelKeywords.txt
		| ScreenName002_HighLevelKeywords.txt
	| DataSet
		| Spread Sheet 001.xlsx
		| Spread Sheet 002.xlsx



- Our test scripts will be stored in the text files (*.txt) also
known as test suites
- A test suite isn't allowed to consist more than 30 test scripts
- 

II. General:
1. Documentation:
- Everything is, will be written has to be documented. As
discussion, our documentation should be devided into 3 sections:
	+ Author: <the author/creator name>
	+ Created Date: [Optional field]
	+ Description: this is the most important section. You might
find the answers for 2 different questions: what and how
	+ Arguments: [data_type] (e.g: number_of_characters [int])
	+ Return: [Optional]

- Example:
Author: minh.nguyen
Created Date: August 17, 2016
Description: this method is used for generating a random string
Arguments:
- length [int]: number of characters of the returned string 
- contain_alphabets [boolean]: Should random string contain alphabets?
- contain_numbers [boolean]: Should random string contain numbers?
Return: a random string


2. Naming convention:
2.1 Library
+ Library: As designed, we implement library as Python syntax 
then import them into Robot Framework. So coding and naming 
covention should follow up Python Documentation
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

2.2 Keyword: According to the section I.1, keywords have separated 
into 2 folder. Normal keywords and High Level keywords
- Normal keyword: all keywords should be stored in the Screen
Name.txt
- High Level Keywords: these keywords are used for making test
scripts are easy to read (looks like natural language).
